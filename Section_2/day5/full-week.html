    <h2>100 days of code challange</h2>
    <a href="../day4/index.html">Home</a>
    <p>
      I have accepted this challange to improve my skills as a front end
      developer. As I have been working for 4 months as a full stack developer,
      I have relised that it's realy important that I understand the basics of
      web development like html, css, and js.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was advised by a friend to take this course. It's important to enhance
      my skills in web development basics before starting with frameworks or
      databases.
